## Usage 
At the moment is working only in Linux. But I suggest trying it in a Linux container. 
A Debian-based container has provided an install.sh to prepare the dependencies.

```bash
sh install.sh

```


Also can work with pip but has not been tested. 
```bash
pip i

```

In theoretically working on windows as well. I'm not sure about that. 
For a test run just start the start.sh. 
```bash
sh start.sh

```
and also the pytest test.py is there.
